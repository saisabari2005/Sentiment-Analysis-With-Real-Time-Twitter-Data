    "# Context of the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to collect, preprocess, and analyze tweets using Python. The workflow includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries:**  \n",
    "    Essential libraries for data collection, processing, sentiment analysis, and visualization are imported, including `tweepy`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `nltk`, `textblob`, `PIL`, and `wordcloud`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Twitter API Setup:**  \n",
    "    The Twitter API is accessed using Tweepy with a bearer token for authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tweet Collection:**  \n",
    "    Tweets are fetched using the Twitter API. Different queries are used to search for recent tweets containing specific hashtags (e.g., `#iphone`, `#elonmusk`), excluding retweets and filtering by language.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pagination:**  \n",
    "    Tweepy’s `Paginator` is used to handle fetching multiple pages of tweets, allowing for the collection of a larger dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Extraction:**  \n",
    "    The tweets are extracted from the API response and stored in lists. The text content of each tweet is isolated for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Storage:**  \n",
    "    The extracted tweet texts are saved into a pandas DataFrame and exported to a CSV file for persistent storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Data Exploration:**  \n",
    "    The DataFrame is displayed and individual tweets are accessed for inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Text Preprocessing:**  \n",
    "    Regular expressions are used to clean tweet text, such as removing retweet tags and converting text to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Preparation for Analysis:**  \n",
    "    The cleaned data is prepared for further analysis, such as sentiment analysis or word cloud generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a foundation for social media data mining, text preprocessing, and basic exploratory analysis of Twitter data."
